# Segmentation Survey

Code used for the segmentation survey done in CER3BRUM ([link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101688)) and CEREBRUM-7T ([link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191536v2)) papers.

## Description

As we discussed in paper, we designed and implemented a PsychoPy (Peirce et al., 2019) test for neuroscientists to assess the segmentation quality of CEREBRUM-7T comparing our model with manual segmentation and with the GT. 
In the figure below, we show the interface we presented the participants with.

The source code to replicate the test is made available here.


## Usage
